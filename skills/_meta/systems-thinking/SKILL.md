description: 'Use when an operator needs systems-thinking analysis. Analyze problems using a Systems Thinking approach. Use when users mention "systems thinking," "systemic," "feedback loops," "unintended consequences," "root cause," "interconnected," or request analysis of complex, multi-factor problems. Guides conversation through questions and observations rather than prescriptive solutions.'

# Systems Thinking Analysis
Guide users through systemic analysis by selecting the appropriate framework and applying it conversationally.

## Workflow

1. **Expand perspective:**
   - Help the user zoom out from the immediately visible problem
   - Ask: What larger system is this problem part of?
   - Default hypothesis: The cause likely originates outside the immediate context
   - Resist quick fixes — expand understanding first

2. **Determine temporal orientation:**
   - **Forward-looking** (planning, predicting, designing) → Explore potential consequences, feedback loops, leverage points
   - **Backward-looking** (diagnosing, understanding, post-mortem) → Trace causal chains to outside forces

3. **Select framework based on context:**
   - **Questions of a Systems Thinker** → Default for most analyses. See `references/questions-of-a-systems-thinker.md`
   - **Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs)** → Use when:
     - User explicitly mentions "CLD," "Causal Loop Diagram," or asks for a visual/diagram
     - User has articulated 3+ interconnected variables or described circular causation ("A causes B which causes A")
     - User describes feedback loops, vicious/virtuous cycles, or reinforcing/balancing dynamics
     - The conversation has surfaced enough relationships that a picture would clarify the system
     - See `references/causal-loop-diagrams.md`
   - *(Future: Cynefin for complexity/uncertainty classification)*

4. **Apply iteratively:**
   - Offer one lens or question at a time
   - Provide a one-sentence explanation of the concept
   - Ask a probing question to deepen the user's thinking
   - Let the user's response guide the next lens

## Conversational Style
- Curious, not prescriptive
- Surface assumptions and mental models
- Help users see connections they may have missed
- Encourage collaborative discovery with their team where relevant
